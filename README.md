# The Expansion of ~~Humanity~~ Ultra Rabbits
A repository with algorithms and simple simulation of ultra rabbit populations. Feel free to improve this project as much as you want!

Ideas on how to develop the project:
1. Include the distance between the rabbits
2. Include non-unary populations
3. Track more features
4. Use a structure other than deque with fast data access and fast insertion and deletion of elements (like a segment tree)
5. Include other civilizations
